# Bio

<!-- On this website, you will find a selection of my published works, including scholarly articles, monographs, and translations. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects, as well as information on upcoming events and conferences where I will be speaking. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my life's work as one of Middle-earth's greatest scholars and thinkers. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mariaadeliawidijanto@gmail.com) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects. -->

I am a Master's student in the Erasmus Mundus Global Forestry (GLOFOR) program, specializing in landscape ecology and modeling. My skills lie in spatial data analysis, process-based and statistical models, and database management, which I am actively developing further through my Master's studies. I'm excited to leverage these skills and my passion for forestry in a professional setting, and I'm currently open to new opportunities.
